/*NOTES ON BITMASKS:
 categoryBitMask: number property that defines the type of object this object considers for collisions. Category must be attached to object for collisions to take place or to send notifications of said collision.
 
 collisionBitMask: number property that defines what category of objects this node can collides with. By default, this is set to "everything".
 
 contactTestBitMask: number propety that defines the type of collisions we want to be notified about. Contact with no collision bit mask means you'll be notified when they overlap, but objects won't bounce off of one another. By default, this is set to send no notifications at all.
